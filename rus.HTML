					<h3>Fringed with shimmering white-sand beaches shaded by coconut palms and sea grapes, and lined with brightly painted open-air beach bars serving sizzling barbecue, spirited rum punch and live reggae tunes, Anguilla is the Caribbean dream come true. .The crystal clear waters and vibrant reefs offer spectacular snorkeling, glass bottom kayaking and sailing to scattered offshore islands and atolls.</h3>
					<p>The island's rich and varied history dates back to Native American and Arawak colonization, and exceptional rock art is still being discovered at sites such as Fountain Cavern National Park. And unlike many nearby islands, the flat terrain makes it easy to get around by car, bike or quad. </p>
				
				<p>There's a catch, of course. Anguilla is not a cheap destination and authenticity is a priority here. Luxury hotels and private villas cater to members of high society who crave a vacation under the radar. Visit us off-season for a cheaper taste of paradise.</p>

					<h3>A trip to this small, solar-powered island is the quintessential Anguilla dream experience. Imagine a white sand beach lined with palm trees, translucent water for snorkeling amid coral teeming with turtles and groupers.</h3>
					<p> The hotel restaurant is open every hour. The boat departs from the second dock at Sandy Ground and prepares delicious grilled lobster, chicken, ribs and other delights. The bar serves island-inspired cocktails, including JoJo's strong rum punch. Buy tickets at the office at Sandy Ground</p>
					<p>The trip takes about 10 minutes, but the captain often slows  the boat in the bay to point out sea turtles that come up to breathe. Food is only served from 12pm to 3pm. the island as the small crew takes  a while to cook. The staff also rents out loungers ($5 with lunch, $10 without lunch), but no snorkel gear. Buy some from the Scuba Shack at Sandy Ground if you need them.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Idyllic Shoal Bay East, a gorgeous 2-mile stretch of bright pink-white sand covered in tiny crushed seashells, is still miraculously pest-free. There are a handful of small resorts and villas, as well as  beach bars dotting the beach, but it's surprisingly quiet even in high season. Bring your snorkel gear (or rent some locally) as the crystal clear turquoise waters are perfect for underwater viewing.</p>
					
                    
                <p>The a lot of idyllic finish is that the western (lower) 0.5 between Zemi house and Tropical Sunset. If you wish more action, head to the jap half right by Uncle Ernie'.</p>
					<p>By the way, don't confuse this beach with the slightly less spectacular Shoal Bay West at the other end of the island. Also, when locals say Shoal Bay, they mean Shoal Bay East.</p>
